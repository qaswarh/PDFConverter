Listening to news, music, recordings, recitations etc. is common while hands being on the steering and eyes on the road. My interset developed in utilizing commute time listening books chapter by chapter without getting distracted by using apk on my android<br>

The pdfplumber and pyttsx3 solved my problem. pdf2mp3.py ask user the pdf file name to convert and mp3 file to generate. The user is also asked to provide the start and end page of the pdf file for script to read<br>

The outcome of the query is mp3 audio book for the chapter, user chose the name for the mp3 file.
